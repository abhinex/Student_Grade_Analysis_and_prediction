Student_Grade_Analysis_and_prediction
In the domain of education, fostering student success is a primary goal.
However, the traditional approaches to identifying struggling students often fall short.
Our project addresses this challenge by harsnessing the power of machine learning to predict
student outcomes,thereby enabling educators to intervene and provide timely support.

Data Set Information: The data used is from a Portuguese secondary school. The data includes academic and personal characteristics of the
students as well as final grades. The task is to predict the final grade from the student information.
